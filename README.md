# üîí Locked Token Voting Power Governance (Flow Blockchain)

A decentralized **governance smart contract** that links **voting power to locked tokens**, enabling fair and time-weighted decision-making.  
Users can lock their tokens (in this case, native Flow testnet tokens represented as ETH in the EVM layer) for fixed durations to earn proportional voting power.

## üß© Overview

This smart contract introduces a **voting power system derived from locked tokens** ‚Äî a simplified model of ‚Äúvoting escrow governance.‚Äù  
Participants gain **greater voting power the longer they lock their tokens**. The system supports creating proposals, weighted voting, and automatic result computation ‚Äî all directly on-chain.

Built entirely in **Solidity**, this contract is designed for educational and demonstrative use on Flow‚Äôs EVM-compatible testnet, following strict simplicity constraints:
- **No constructors**
- **No imports**
- **No input fields in external functions**

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚úÖ **Lock Tokens for Time-Based Voting Power**  
Lock tokens for **30, 90, or 365 days** ‚Äî the longer the lock, the higher your voting weight.

‚úÖ **Time-Weighted Voting Power**  
Voting weight = locked amount √ó remaining lock duration (normalized to 30-day units).

‚úÖ **On-Chain Proposal System**  
Create proposals, vote (yes/no), and automatically determine outcomes on-chain.

‚úÖ **Snapshot Protection**  
Voting power is **snapshotted at vote time** ‚Äî users can‚Äôt withdraw or change locks to influence past votes.

‚úÖ **Single Active Proposal**  
To maintain simplicity, only one active proposal exists at a time.

‚úÖ **No Imports or Constructors**  
Fully self-contained Solidity smart contract for maximum transparency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Contract Functions

### üèÅ Initialization
| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `initialize()` | Sets the contract owner. Must be called once after deployment. |

---

### üîê Token Locking
| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `lock30Days()` | Locks tokens for 30 days. |
| `lock90Days()` | Locks tokens for 90 days. |
| `lock365Days()` | Locks tokens for 365 days. |
| `withdrawUnlocked()` | Withdraws tokens once the lock period expires. |

> üí° **Locking Formula:**  
> - 1 wei = 1 token unit.  
> - Voting power increases with both **amount** and **remaining time**.

---

### üó≥Ô∏è Governance Actions
| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `createProposal()` | Creates a new proposal (only one active at a time). |
| `voteYes()` | Votes ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on the active proposal using your current voting power. |
| `voteNo()` | Votes ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on the active proposal using your current voting power. |
| `executeProposal()` | Finalizes voting after the proposal ends and records the result. |

---

### üßæ Utility & Admin
| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `currentVotingWeight(address)` | Returns current voting power for a user. |
| `getLockedAmount(address)` | Shows locked token amount for a user. |
| `getUnlockTime(address)` | Displays the unlock timestamp for a user. |
| `emergencyWithdrawAll()` | Owner-only emergency function to withdraw contract balance. |
